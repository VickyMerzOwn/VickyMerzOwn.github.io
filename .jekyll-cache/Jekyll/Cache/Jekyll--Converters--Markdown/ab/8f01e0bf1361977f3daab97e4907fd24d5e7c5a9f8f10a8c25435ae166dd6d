<blockquote>
  <p>i3 does not allow you to set screen brightness natively. Write a bash script to increase and decrease the screen
brightness in small steps. Now make appropriate key bindings in your i3config file to integrate this with i3.
Find out how on-screen notifications can be rendered. Finally, add support in your script for on-screen 
notifications to show the current brightness level whenever your script is executed.
