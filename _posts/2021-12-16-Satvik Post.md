# Screen Brightness
###### A convenient way to control and keep track of the brightness level of your i3 display...
---
---
#### Problem Statement
>i3 does not allow you to set screen brightness natively. Write a bash script to increase and decrease the screen
brightness in small steps. Now make appropriate key bindings in your i3config file to integrate this with i3.
Find out how on-screen notifications can be rendered. Finally, add support in your script for on-screen 
notifications to show the current brightness level whenever your script is executed.
---
#### Brightness

The significance of i3 window manager on a Power-User's productivity is significant with multiple screens. What's more?
The brightness of all these screens can be adjusted individually by providing necessary keybindings. For the sake of simplicity,
a single display will be considered in answering this question. Firstly, the name of the display whose brightness has to be
adjusted has to be extracted. This will be achieved using the `xrandr` tool, native to linux. Xrandr is used to set the size,
orientation and/or reflection of the outputs for a screen.

* With the query flag, `xrandr -q` outputs the following :
---
<img src="/img/posts/img1.png" alt="drawing" width="100%"/>


* To obtain the relevant (connected) desktop, the output of the previous command is piped through to a 
 `grep ' connected'` command, whose output is as follows :

<img src="/img/posts/img2.png" alt="drawing" width="100%"/>

* To get only the first of the connected desktops (the present one), the output is then piped through to a 
`head -n 1` command
The output remains same there is only one connected desktop here.
* Of this output, finally, we need the first field, which is the name of the current display. For this the command
`cut -d ' ' -f1` is used.

<img src="/img/posts/img3.png" alt="drawing" width="100%"/>

* For increasing / decreasing brightness levels, the brightness is extracted, increased and then set to the increased
level with the following command in a bash script (.sh file):
`xrandr --output Virtual1 --brightness $(echo "$(xrandr --verbose | grep Brightness | grep -o '[0-9].*')+0.1" | bc)
`
Notice the `--output`  argument is set to `Virtual1`, since this is the name of the display as extracted above. 
Brightness is extracted using the appropriate `grep` commands and incremented (as it is the increase_brightness.sh script).
A similar decrease-brightness script is also made with - instead of + .

#### Notifications
Notifications are rendered with the help of external libraries like Dunst. So the following have to be installed first :
* `sudo apt-get install dunst`
* `sudo apt-get install libnotify4`

As a simple kickstarter for Dunst :
* `dunst` command has to be run to start the notification server.
* Notifications are then sent using the `notify-send "brightness level is decreased to $ABC."` command.

In our script, we will run the `dunst &` command so that the server runs in the background whenever the increase-brightness
or decrease-brightness script is run on executing a key-binding and send appropriate notifications of the increased brightness level.

* The following lines are added to the i3config file, which enable execution of respective shell-scripts on invoking the 
 key binding :
  * `bindsym $mod+r exec ~/decrease_brightness.sh`
  * `bindsym $mod+t exec ~/increase_brightness.sh`


Appropriate files are given below :

##### increase-brightness
```bash
#!/bin/bash
dunst &
xrandr --output eDP-1 --brightness $(echo "$(xrandr --verbose | grep Brightness | grep -o '[0-9].*')+0.1" | bc)
ABC=$(echo "$(xrandr --verbose | grep Brightness | grep -o '[0-9].*')")
notify-send "brightness level is increased to $ABC."  
```
  

##### decrease-brightness
```bash
#!/bin/bash
dunst &
xrandr --output eDP-1 --brightness $(echo "$(xrandr --verbose | grep Brightness | grep -o '[0-9].*')-0.1" | bc)
ABC=$(echo "$(xrandr --verbose | grep Brightness | grep -o '[0-9].*')")
notify-send "brightness level is decreased to $ABC."
```
##### Config file
###### Find the appropriate lines towards the end of the config file.
```bash
# This file has been auto-generated by i3-config-wizard(1).
# It will not be overwritten, so edit it as you like.
#
# Should you change your keyboard layout some time, delete
# this file and re-run i3-config-wizard(1).
#

# i3 config file (v4)

# Please see https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html for a complete reference!
